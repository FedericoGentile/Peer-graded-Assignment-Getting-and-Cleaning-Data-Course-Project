- Get data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

- The script is meant to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set and extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
it also creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- To run the code just set your working directory in R to where these project files are and execute the analysis by running run_analysis.R
A new file called tiny_data.txt is created.
